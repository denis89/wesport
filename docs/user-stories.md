<h1>User Stories</h1>

<h2>As web developers we want:</h2>

Users to see an introduction to the website’s purpose - to find a partner for two-player sports - and a form to sign up or log in.

The user can search for a partner, filtering by sport, their rating of how good they are at it, and location.

User is shown a results page of the top matches and a calendar that shows other users’ names on each date they’re available.

The user can click on a day they’re available to see a list with more information about the other available users

The user can choose a partner from the list and contact them via an email form.

Users can add, edit and delete their own profiles with their name, age, gender, photo, sports they’re interested in and how good they are at each one.
